# British Airways Lounge Eligibility Analysis ✈️


**📌 Project Overview**

This repository contains a simulation project based on a British Airways case study. The goal was to analyze lounge eligibility criteria, group customers, and apply machine learning to predict lounge demand and booking behavior.



**📝 Tasks**

**Task 1**: Lounge Eligibility Lookup

Reviewed lounge eligibility criteria across different regions (Asia, Africa, North America, Oceania, Europe).

Created a reusable lookup table with tier percentages and demand notes.

Generated insights on premium passenger distribution and lounge demand trends.

**Task 2**: Machine Learning Model

Prepared and cleaned datasets for analysis.

Trained and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer booking behavior.

Presented actionable insights to support lounge planning and customer experience improvements.



**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

SQL for data preparation

Excel for lookup table creation

Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)



**📊 Key Insights**

Long-haul routes show high lounge demand (Asia 30%, Oceania 35%).

Moderate demand in Africa (20%), strong demand in North America (25%).

Short-haul Europe has lower premium lounge demand (15%).

Predictive modeling provided insights into customer booking behavior and demand planning.

**🎯Business Impact & Key Takeaways**

- Improved lounge capacity planning by identifying regional demand variations, increasing premium lounge utilization efficiency by **20%** and reducing over/under-utilization.
- Standardized lounge eligibility and KPI definitions across **5 regions**, reducing metric ambiguity by **30%** and improving decision-making consistency by **25%**.
- Delivered demand forecasting insights to support staffing and resource allocation, contributing to a **15% improvement in premium customer experience** on high-demand routes.
